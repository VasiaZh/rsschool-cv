 The task was as follows: Write a function get_next_prime(num) that takes a natural number num as an argument and returns the first prime number greater than num.
 
//function declaration

def is_prime(num):
    if num == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

 //function declaration

def get_next_prime(num):
    x = num + 1
    while is_prime(x) == False:
        x += 1
    return x
